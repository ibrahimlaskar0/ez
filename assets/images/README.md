# Placeholder Images

## no-image.jpg
A simple placeholder image that shows when uploaded files are not found.

This will be replaced with an actual placeholder image when the backend is implemented.

## Backend Integration
- ID Proof images will be stored in: `/uploads/id-proofs/`
- Payment screenshots will be stored in: `/uploads/payment-screenshots/`
- Naming convention: `{email}_{filename}`
